# stlite: Serverless Streamlit

A port of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to WebAssembly, powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).

Streamlit is a Python web app framework for the fast development of data apps. This project is to make it run completely on web browsers.

# Cognite's modifications

We are using this in the Fusion app, where the Streamlit app is loaded and rendered using an iframe. The modifications we have done to `stlite` repo is

- Handle token exchange from Fusion so that the Python SDK is authenticated
- Handle the app configuration so apps stored in CDF are being mounted properly
- Code completion support
- GitHub actions to do deployment to Firebase

## How to update to latest upstream

This is currently a fork of the [upstream repository](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite). The process of updating to latest version is to just merge in the latest changes and fix merge conflicts

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whitphx/stlite
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b update-stlite-branch-name
git merge upstream/main
```

Now you will likely get a set of merge conflicts. The typical repeating pattern is the github workflows (we have deleted a couple of them and modified some of them). The goal in 2025 is to move all fork functionalities into upstream repository so no fork is required.

## Local development

The dev setup is a bit cumbersome. We have tried to set up dev containers, but due to some strict package rules, typically an exact version
of the same Python environment as the running Pyodide instance is required (see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)). There is no devcontainer image
that fullfils this requirement, so all attempts have failed. Feel free to help out if you know how!

For general development instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md). In addition, you need to have set up JFROG for private packages:

TL;DR: make sure you have the right environment and run `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=16384 USE_CONSTRAINTS_FILE=false make browser`.

### JFROG Authentication

In order to install private packages we need to authenticate. We use jFrog for our internal registry.

#### 1. Generate a jFrog token

- Go to [jFrog](https://cognite.jfrog.io/ui/) and log in with your Cognite credentials
- Click on your username in the top right corner and select "Edit Profile"
- Click on "Generate an Identity Token"
- Give the token a meaningful description like "npm registry" and click "Next". ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Copy the generated token and store it somewhere temporarily. You won't be able to see it again.

#### 2. Authenticate with the jFrog token

- Run `yarn npm login` in the terminal
- Enter the following information when prompted:
  - Username: your jFrog username(usually name.lastname)
  - Password: the token you generated in Step 1

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) `npm -g install yarn`
- grpc `brew install grpc`
- protobuf `brew install protobuf`

## Cloning the repository

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cognitedata/stlite
cd stlite
```

## Building and serving

```
USE_CONSTRAINTS_FILE=false make mountable
cd packages/mountable
yarn start
```

This will serve the app at http://localhost:3000.

`NOTE: If you are making any change in the kernel (/packages/kernel) make sure that you build both kernel and mountable before serving. Just run `yarn build` in both folders.`

## Serving in Fusion

Using the development version of Fusion (or a local build), you can override the Streamlit URL.

1. Open dev.fusion.cogniteapp.com and login to your project
2. Before opening Streamlit, open the Chrome Devtools
3. Go to Application tab
4. Open Session storage and open the bucket for dev.fusion.cogniteapp.com
5. Add a new key STREAMLIT_IFRAME with value http://localhost:3000
6. Reload the page and open Streamlit
7. Ensure Streamlit is hosted from localhost by inspecting network traffic in the Network tab

Approaches for browsers other than Chrome is left as an excercies to the reader.

See also [README](https://github.com/cognitedata/fusion/blob/master/apps/streamlit/README.md) for the Fusion subapp that includes
the UI shell for the application.

# Releasing

Releasing is done by merging changes to the `release-production` branch. This will trigger [Github Actions](https://github.com/cognitedata/stlite/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml) that deploys the changes. All releases should be tagged `release-YYYYMMDD` to make it easy to determine what version was released at any time. The procedure for releasing goes as follows:

1. Create a branch and PR for merging changes from `main` to `release-production`.
1. Merge branch to `release-production` after review
1. After merge, check out `release-production` locally and create a new tag:

```bash
git checkout release-production
git pull
git tag release-20240521 # Change date
git push --tags
```

Note that changes in `main` are automatically deployed to the staging environment using [Github Actions](https://github.com/cognitedata/stlite/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml).
